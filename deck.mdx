# What is GraphQL?

---

<Image src="/images/graphql.png" />

---
export default Layout

# A Query Language for your API

---
export default Layout

# Why Should I Care ?

---
export default Layout

# GraphQL APIs have a strongly typed schema

```notes
GraphQL uses Schema Definition Language to define your API and it requires you to set all types.

There is no such thing as an object.
```

---
export default Layout

```js
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

const Schema = gql`
  type Speaker {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    photo: String
    talks: [Talk]
  }

  type Talk {
    name: String
    speaker: Speaker
  }
`;
```

```notes
In this case we are creating a schema that has Speaker and Talk and a speaker can have multiple talks but a talk can only have one speaker and all their fields are typed
```
